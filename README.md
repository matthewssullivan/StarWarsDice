Dice Rolling App for FFG's Star Wars RPG

This app is a barebones start to a dice rolling app using Fantasy Flight Game's Narrative Dice System.
For those of you not familiar. The NDS has 3 axis using 7 types of dice.
Right now I'm just testing the functionality. My next step is to add a GUI that calls the main function with appropriate numbers of dice.
